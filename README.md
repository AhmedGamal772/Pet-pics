Petpics is a simple web application built with Flask that allows users to upload images of pets and classify them as either a dog or a cat using a pre-trained TensorFlow model.
Features
Image Upload: Users can upload images of pets through a web interface.
Image Classification: The application uses a TensorFlow model to predict whether the uploaded image is of a dog or a cat.
Real-time Feedback: The classification result is returned immediately to the user.
Technologies Used
Flask: A lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python.
TensorFlow: An open-source platform for machine learning used to load and run the pre-trained model.
Pillow: A Python Imaging Library (PIL) fork used for image processing.
NumPy: A library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
